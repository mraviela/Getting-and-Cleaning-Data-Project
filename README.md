# [Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project]
Johns Hopkings Data Science specialization on Coursera

## Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

### Dataset Description

The project taps into an exciting area of wearable computing, where a number of big brands compete to develop clever algorithms. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

### Requirements and Review criteria
* Create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* The submitted data set is tidy.
* The Github repo contains the required scripts.
* GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
* The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

### Repository contents
According to the requirements for this project you will find next items:
1. R Script "run_analysis.R".
2. README.md file, that actually is the file you are reading.
3. CodeBook, is the file "CodeBook.md"
4. The tidy data set file "tidy_data.txt" produced by R script execution.

### How to run this project
1. Clone repo
2. Run R script "run_analysis.R"
3. Two files will be generated "tidy_data.txt" as project requires, and "tidy_data.csv" because is easier to import to Excel or Numbers.
